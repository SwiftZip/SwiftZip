SwiftZip is a Swift wrapper for [libzip](https://libzip.org/) providing an API to read, create and modify zip archives.
Files can be added from data buffers, files, or compressed data copied directly from other zip archives.
Changes made without closing the archive can be reverted.

Visit SwiftZip project at GitHub: [https://github.com/SwiftZip/SwiftZip](https://github.com/SwiftZip/SwiftZip).

**Note:** SwiftZip is currently under development and API may change slightly as the project evolves.
